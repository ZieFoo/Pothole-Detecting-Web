To ensure that python3.py works, make sure the folder contains appv3.py, best.onnx, and the templates folder.

To run the program, open a terminal, navigate to the folder where appv3.py is located, and run:

```bash
python appv3.py
```

To run the server using srv.us, open another terminal and use:

```bash
ssh srv.us -R 1:127.0.0.1:5000
```

You will receive an HTTPS link. Copy that link and open it on your device. The program should now run successfully.
